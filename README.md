# MiniMax Implementation
A single player Tic Tac Toe C ++ program
## What I learned:
- Implemented Mini-Max algorithm to my Tic Tac Toe program inspired by this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-hh51ncgDI
- Learned about basics of game theory, game trees, and decision theory  
##	What I could add: 
- Implement alpha and beta pruning to speed up algorithm 
- Expand algorithm to a larger Tic Tac Toe board dimension like 4 by 4
